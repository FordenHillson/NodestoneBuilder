# Maplestory Tri-Node Builder (Beta)

## Purpose
The web application allows users to find and formulate their trinode sets.

## Features

- Allows users to input all their trinode combinations
- Real time feedback on the current state of the trinode set
- Nodescore
  - To faciliate easier nodestone selection, a score of -1 to 6 is given as to how useful a specific trinode currently is given the already selected trinode. 
  - A score of 1 is added for each skill in the trinode that is deemed a useful(selected by user). 
  - Another score is added for each useful skill to the current pool of trinodes as long as adding the selected trinode would result in the skill appearing a total of 2 times or less in the current pool.
- Compute for number of Ideal nodes and current node efficiency
